# Smart-Traffic-Multi-Agent-

# 🚦 Multi-Agent System for Smart Traffic Management

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Urban traffic congestion causes time loss, pollution, and delays. Traditional traffic systems are static and inefficient.

## 🎯 Our Solution
We developed a simulation of a multi-agent system where AI-powered traffic lights, smart vehicles, and emergency response agents collaborate in real-time to reduce congestion and prioritize emergency response.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Dynamic traffic light control based on real-time data
- Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication
- Simulation of accidents, roadblocks, and rush hour
- Emergency vehicle prioritization
- Event-driven architecture with agent coordination

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the agents:
python src/event_simulator.py
python src/traffic_light_agent.py
python src/vehicle_agent.py
python src/emergency_agent.py

4. View logs/output to see agent interactions.
