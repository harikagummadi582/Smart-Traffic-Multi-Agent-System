✅ Slide 1: Problem Statement & My Solution
Title: Solving Real-Time Traffic Challenges with AI Agents
The Problem:
Urban traffic systems struggle to adapt quickly during emergencies and peak traffic hours.
Traditional systems follow fixed signal timers, leading to congestion and delays.
My Solution:
I developed a multi-agent simulation to create adaptive and intelligent traffic control.
Each AI agent is responsible for handling a specific aspect of the traffic system, enabling decentralized and dynamic decision-making.
✅ Slide 2: Technical Architecture
Title: System Architecture & Agent Design
Agents Involved:
Event Simulator – Generates random real-time events (rush hour, roadblocks, etc.) and updates traffic data.
Emergency Agent – Detects emergencies and simulates route clearance.
Traffic Light Agent – Dynamically adjusts green signal durations based on traffic volume and events.
Vehicle Agent – Simulates vehicle behavior (e.g., rerouting, slowing down) based on traffic conditions.
Communication Flow:
All agents interact by reading from and writing to shared JSON files:
event.json
datasets/traffic_data.json
✅ Slide 3: Demo & Key Features
Title: System in Action
Live Console Outputs Show:
Signal timings dynamically change depending on vehicle count and event type.
Emergency routes are cleared when an emergency is detected.
Vehicles respond to traffic events like roadblocks and accidents.
Key Features:
Real-time simulation of traffic scenarios
Adaptive and event-aware traffic signal control
Agent-based, modular architecture
✅ Slide 4: Challenges & What I Learned
Title: Roadblocks & Learnings
Challenges Faced:
Managing coordination between independently running agents using shared files
Designing scalable logic that responds to dynamic scenarios
Creating realistic traffic conditions with limited resources
Key Learnings:
Modular agent design made debugging and testing easier
Time-based coordination is crucial for simulating real-time systems
Simulation helped me better understand traffic control logic and system design
✅ Slide 5: Future Enhancements
Title: Taking It Further
Replace file-based communication with real-time protocols like MQTT or WebSocket
Add a graphical dashboard to visualize traffic patterns and junction data
Integrate predictive analytics to forecast traffic flow and events
Use real-world traffic datasets for validation and testing
